I have been extremely happy with Carlos Santos for the price and quality and I am surprised to see a lack of reviews out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I don't know why, but I am quite proud of taking this shot!](https://i.redd.it/5d3xwh1mocg21.jpg)\n\nAs always, I will write my free-flowing thoughts here but anyone who wants to read the whole polished thing [here's the link](https://www.misiuacademy.com/carlos-santos-boots-review-coimbra-patina/).\n\nSo! Let's start.\n\n**Super Quick Background**\n\nCarlos Santos is a Portuguese Shoemaker with roots that date back to WWII era (1942). He initially worked as a young boy in the shoemaking factory then slowly worked his way up the ladder, eventually purchasing the business. The Zarco Factory now in North Portugal is what Northampton is for England.\n\nSantos makes mostly Goodyear Welted Shoes, with a few blake stitched, sneakers, accessories and even has a women's line. Additionally, they craft shoes for other companies such as Herring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Example of few of the patina colors](https://i.redd.it/woconhwzpcg21.jpg)\n\nVery well known for their Patina service that has some stunning colors, both classic and unconventional. There is also a very limited rare handgrade line apparently that is magnificent!\n\n**Today's Specifications**\n\n* **Brand**: [Carlos Santos](http://santosshoes.com)\n* **Type**: Lace-Up Boot\n* **Color**: Coimbra Patina\n* **Reference** **Style**: 8866\n* **Last**: 234\n* **Size**: UK 7\n* **Width:**\u00a0F (Regular)\n* **Sole**: Commando\n* **Construction**: Goodyear Welt\n* **Eyelets**: 4 Normal &amp; 4 Hook\n* **Leather**: Smooth Calfskin\n* **Made In**: Portugal\n* **Retail** **Price**: 419 \u20ac/475 $/370 \u00a3/4380 SEK (Including VAT)\n\n**Unboxing**\n\nLike last time, unboxing is a very pleasant experience. My packaged arrived with TNT wrapped up nicely. There is protective foam inside, a bit of light brown thin paper separating the shoes, a plastic shoe horn tucked inside the boots (which works surprisingly well actually and is a nice gesture), a small leaflet explaining the GYW system and the boots themselves. Here's the first picture I took just after opening the box.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Love at first sight](https://i.redd.it/rilaamiiqcg21.jpg)\n\nI also noticed that the box has a very nice houndstooth pattern to it. I like that touch it gives it some...character?\n\n**Style**\n\nThis is a Lace-Up Derby style boot, which means it has an open lacing system. It has 4 normal eyelets and 4 hooks on the top, paired with dark laces. The color choices are great and give a very nice uniform feel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tif0raa3scg21.jpg\n\nThe facing has a hockey stick shape to it, which I really like and the Cap-Toe is burnished in the classic Carlos Santos way. It is very dark and borderline black but damn it looks good!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kjweizv4scg21.jpg\n\nThe sole is not your usual dainite/vibram but a commando sole. It is a little more bulky, but is an absolute tank and i think works great with the aesthetics of the boot.\n\nThe last is soft-chiselled and overall I would say this is a boot you can wear with anything. Wear it with a suit and it will look like a derby, unless someone goes on all 4 and looks at your soles closely. Just kick them :)\n\n**Size &amp; Fit**\n\nI own 4 pairs of Santos Shoes but this is the first time I tried the 234 last. I own a pair of sneakers and the double monks on Z401. The latter was slightly uncomfortable on the first 2-3 wears due to a heel blister but I decided to go again with my usual size (UK7). It turned out to be a great decision as these are TTS.\n\nHere is a comparison of my other dress shoes on the same size to give you a feel on design, shape and style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CS 401, CS 234, Loake Capital, Loake Jockey](https://i.redd.it/tk5qasjhscg21.jpg)\n\nNotice how the 234 is the longest. 401 is probably not for those with narrow feet. The Jockey on the other hand is quite round but took me 5 months to fully break-in.\n\nThe 234 has a generous instep and has a bit of space for your toes which is nice. It fits very well with both thick and thin socks which is a relief for me. Snug but not uncomfortable I would say, or just right. If you are one of those with feet that sit between two sizes, I would suggest thinking of the socks you will use.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nShocked and happy at the same time, these were so comfortable from the get go. Easy to put on with the elastic loop and as easy to take off. It takes a while to tie the laces so these are not the boots to escape from the angry husband.\n\nIn Sweden we have a lot of snow and they spray little rocks everywhere for traction. When the snow melts, it is quite slippery or mushy after rain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ykgyv2rztcg21.jpg\n\nThe first two wears with these boots were in such conditions and I am happy to report that no water came in, they retained their shiny exterior, the soles are made from adamantium and the leather is so soft and i love the way it hugs your feet. A little annoying though is that some of the rocks get stuck in the gaps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/p1u9uy54ucg21.jpg\n\nI got very minor heel pain on my left foot after about 6 hours on the first wear but it completely disappeared after the second. This is the fastest break-in period for any of the shoes I own.\n\n**Quality**\n\nI have worn these about 4 times so far so we will see how they fare in the future but I am very impressed but i have learned to expect that from Carlos Santos.\n\nThe leather is superb as I mentioned, very smooth to the touch, looks fantastic and comes with a high shine out of the box. The Patina is also superb and any variations you might see are not an issue, it is part of the design. You can be certain that your shoe will be unique!\n\nA first quick look revealed no problems or inconsistencies, but a closer look on the stitching of the welt showed a tiny bit of a blemish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i6hsn3vmucg21.jpg\n\nEverything else was great though so I am super satisfied! Here are a few more pictures just because you love them so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View from the back, after two days in the snow](https://i.redd.it/3s1jcohsucg21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Overview](https://i.redd.it/y8r6wawxucg21.jpg)\n\n**Summary**\n\nAbsolutely fantastic boot for the price, especially if you can snatch one during sales in Skoak, Pediwear, Afinepairofshoes, cavour etc.\n\nLooks great, with high quality leather (though some can argue it is a bit thin), a great sole to tackle the winter and overall quality stitching and attention to detail.\n\nI really don't wanna sound biased but it is just so good considering the pricepoint, value and quality ratio. I don't see how you can go wrong with Carlos Santos unless you have very narrow feet. The 234 last is classified as F (regular) so you make your judgement.\n\nI would like to thank everyone that reads this, and everyone that will bother clicking on my actual article. I spent a lot of time shooting and writing :) I feel everyone should try Carlos Santos and this is why I have included them in my [best under 400$ brands](https://www.misiuacademy.com/best-mens-dress-shoes-2019-part-1/).\n\nYour comments, suggestions and even criticism are all welcome!\n\nAnd a couple more pics!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/q0j0g9ysvcg21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/71nyonttvcg21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/pw2k2hiuvcg21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6jg875nvvcg21.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/t7yhbhmxvcg21.jpg", "author_fullname": "t2_xg7tq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "[Review] Carlos Santos Lace Up Boots Review - Style 8866 in the Coimbra Patina &amp; 234 Last", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/goodyearwelt", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 97, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3s1jcohsucg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 1733, "x": 1300, "u": "https://i.redd.it/3s1jcohsucg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "3s1jcohsucg21"}, "tk5qasjhscg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 796, "x": 1300, "u": "https://i.redd.it/tk5qasjhscg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "tk5qasjhscg21"}, "kjweizv4scg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 975, "x": 1300, "u": "https://i.redd.it/kjweizv4scg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "kjweizv4scg21"}, "ykgyv2rztcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 750, "x": 1000, "u": "https://i.redd.it/ykgyv2rztcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "ykgyv2rztcg21"}, "i6hsn3vmucg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 975, "x": 1300, "u": "https://i.redd.it/i6hsn3vmucg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "i6hsn3vmucg21"}, "woconhwzpcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 444, "x": 1475, "u": "https://i.redd.it/woconhwzpcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "woconhwzpcg21"}, "p1u9uy54ucg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 1207, "x": 2000, "u": "https://i.redd.it/p1u9uy54ucg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "p1u9uy54ucg21"}, "pw2k2hiuvcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 4032, "x": 3024, "u": "https://i.redd.it/pw2k2hiuvcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "pw2k2hiuvcg21"}, "rilaamiiqcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 1189, "x": 1500, "u": "https://i.redd.it/rilaamiiqcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "rilaamiiqcg21"}, "q0j0g9ysvcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 2304, "x": 3072, "u": "https://i.redd.it/q0j0g9ysvcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "q0j0g9ysvcg21"}, "71nyonttvcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 3024, "x": 4032, "u": "https://i.redd.it/71nyonttvcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "71nyonttvcg21"}, "6jg875nvvcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 855, "x": 1080, "u": "https://i.redd.it/6jg875nvvcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "6jg875nvvcg21"}, "5d3xwh1mocg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 906, "x": 1300, "u": "https://i.redd.it/5d3xwh1mocg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "5d3xwh1mocg21"}, "t7yhbhmxvcg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 2304, "x": 3072, "u": "https://i.redd.it/t7yhbhmxvcg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "t7yhbhmxvcg21"}, "y8r6wawxucg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 2304, "x": 3072, "u": "https://i.redd.it/y8r6wawxucg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "y8r6wawxucg21"}, "tif0raa3scg21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 1050, "x": 1400, "u": "https://i.redd.it/tif0raa3scg21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "tif0raa3scg21"}}, "name": "t3_aq7uu8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 152, "domain": "self.goodyearwelt", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 152, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pcB1lnPgRQv1E3Akv9fxtAy5K3uL0hWzrVUTL9jCCQ0.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1550101410.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in dire need for a winter boot and the most appealing option seemed to be Meermin&amp;#39;s Shearling Lined Boot until I saw the one I will review today. I have been extremely happy with Carlos Santos for the price and quality and I am surprised to see a lack of reviews out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/5d3xwh1mocg21.jpg\"&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why, but I am quite proud of taking this shot!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I will write my free-flowing thoughts here but anyone who wants to read the whole polished thing &lt;a href=\"https://www.misiuacademy.com/carlos-santos-boots-review-coimbra-patina/\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s the link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So! Let&amp;#39;s start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Quick Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos Santos is a Portuguese Shoemaker with roots that date back to WWII era (1942). He initially worked as a young boy in the shoemaking factory then slowly worked his way up the ladder, eventually purchasing the business. The Zarco Factory now in North Portugal is what Northampton is for England.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Santos makes mostly Goodyear Welted Shoes, with a few blake stitched, sneakers, accessories and even has a women&amp;#39;s line. Additionally, they craft shoes for other companies such as Herring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/woconhwzpcg21.jpg\"&gt;Example of few of the patina colors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very well known for their Patina service that has some stunning colors, both classic and unconventional. There is also a very limited rare handgrade line apparently that is magnificent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&amp;#39;s Specifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"http://santosshoes.com\"&gt;Carlos Santos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Lace-Up Boot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color&lt;/strong&gt;: Coimbra Patina&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Style&lt;/strong&gt;: 8866&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last&lt;/strong&gt;: 234&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: UK 7&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Width:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0F (Regular)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sole&lt;/strong&gt;: Commando&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt;: Goodyear Welt&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyelets&lt;/strong&gt;: 4 Normal &amp;amp; 4 Hook&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leather&lt;/strong&gt;: Smooth Calfskin&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made In&lt;/strong&gt;: Portugal&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retail&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: 419 \u20ac/475 $/370 \u00a3/4380 SEK (Including VAT)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unboxing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like last time, unboxing is a very pleasant experience. My packaged arrived with TNT wrapped up nicely. There is protective foam inside, a bit of light brown thin paper separating the shoes, a plastic shoe horn tucked inside the boots (which works surprisingly well actually and is a nice gesture), a small leaflet explaining the GYW system and the boots themselves. Here&amp;#39;s the first picture I took just after opening the box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/rilaamiiqcg21.jpg\"&gt;Love at first sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that the box has a very nice houndstooth pattern to it. I like that touch it gives it some...character?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Lace-Up Derby style boot, which means it has an open lacing system. It has 4 normal eyelets and 4 hooks on the top, paired with dark laces. The color choices are great and give a very nice uniform feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/tif0raa3scg21.jpg\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/tif0raa3scg21.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The facing has a hockey stick shape to it, which I really like and the Cap-Toe is burnished in the classic Carlos Santos way. It is very dark and borderline black but damn it looks good!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/kjweizv4scg21.jpg\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/kjweizv4scg21.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sole is not your usual dainite/vibram but a commando sole. It is a little more bulky, but is an absolute tank and i think works great with the aesthetics of the boot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last is soft-chiselled and overall I would say this is a boot you can wear with anything. Wear it with a suit and it will look like a derby, unless someone goes on all 4 and looks at your soles closely. Just kick them :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size &amp;amp; Fit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I own 4 pairs of Santos Shoes but this is the first time I tried the 234 last. I own a pair of sneakers and the double monks on Z401. The latter was slightly uncomfortable on the first 2-3 wears due to a heel blister but I decided to go again with my usual size (UK7). It turned out to be a great decision as these are TTS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a comparison of my other dress shoes on the same size to give you a feel on design, shape and style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/tk5qasjhscg21.jpg\"&gt;CS 401, CS 234, Loake Capital, Loake Jockey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice how the 234 is the longest. 401 is probably not for those with narrow feet. The Jockey on the other hand is quite round but took me 5 months to fully break-in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 234 has a generous instep and has a bit of space for your toes which is nice. It fits very well with both thick and thin socks which is a relief for me. Snug but not uncomfortable I would say, or just right. If you are one of those with feet that sit between two sizes, I would suggest thinking of the socks you will use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shocked and happy at the same time, these were so comfortable from the get go. Easy to put on with the elastic loop and as easy to take off. It takes a while to tie the laces so these are not the boots to escape from the angry husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Sweden we have a lot of snow and they spray little rocks everywhere for traction.

This is my first post\u2014I\u2019ve been lurking for a few months, which is how it found out about Zeb.\n\nThis is actually the second pair that I\u2019ve bought from Zeb. The others were for my wife and I haven\u2019t posted a review because I haven\u2019t gotten an on-foot picture yet. \n\nAnyway, I stumbled on Zeb because I was looking for a good shoemaker in Zagreb (where I live).\n\nORDERING\n\nThis process was painless and informative. Bojan is really patient and answers all questions thoroughly. He\u2019s also a shoe fanatic who really knows his stuff and he helped me refine my initial (bad) ideas about the build I wanted. The boots are made-to-measure and I was able to go to the workshop and have Bruno (the shoemaker) measure my feet, instead of making a foot tracing and taking measurements at home. I was also able to meet Bojan in person to see leather samples and discuss options. Initially I wanted a cap toe London boot, but on the advice of a friend I decided to swing for the fences and get the Giau wingtip boot instead. Once the order was placed the boots were finished in about 2.5\u20133 weeks and I met Bojan again to pick them up.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSIONS\n\nBojan puts a lot of importance on small details, which is apparent immediately with the custom branded wooden box. The shoes come with their own branded shoe bags and I bought shoe trees (extra charge). I decided to get a matching belt on a whim and it came with its own small bag! They use a piece of crust leather for an insole (on top of the midsole) instead of lining leather which is a nice touch. Bojan also does a really nice job of polishing them up prior to delivery.\n\nCONSTRUCTION \n\nHere are the specs:\n\nGiau boot sans pull tab on the heel\n\nLondon last (heavily modified)\n\nHand-painted/dyed crust leather (Carli tannery, I think)\n\nDouble leather sole with Vibram lug half soles and natural edge dressing\n\nWhite welt stitching with black welt top\n\nVeldtschoen sandwich construction (mmmmm sandwich)\n\n\nThe boots are about 8 inches high, but I\u2019m given to understand that the height will change slightly with sizing changes to keep the proportions nice and neat. The workmanship is impeccable. Tight stitching, no loose grain, nothing to complain about. I started out with my eye on the Dolomiti last, which is their roundest toed last, but decided to go outside of my comfort zone and go for the more elongated London last. I have fairly large feet (45 sneakers, 44 dress shoes\u2014D or E width) and I was worried that they might come out looking like clown shoes, but the proportions are perfect and they don\u2019t really look all that long on foot despite being an inch or more longer than most of my sneakers. \n\nFIRST WEAR \n\nAs soon as I got home after picking them up. I sat on my couch and admired them for a time before going to put them on. When I did, I immediately ran into a problem\u2014I couldn\u2019t get my foot in. I panicked a bit, wondering if there had been a problem in measuring or construction. I decided to give it a second go with different socks and managed to get my foot in after some strategic yanking. I asked Bojan if it was normally this hard to put the boot on and he said that it was, and it was that way because they put the laces as far up the vamp as they could for a more elegant look. I also have an instep that resembles the forehead of a sea lion beach master and my foot is wide back through the instep, making the heavy modifications to the last necessary. \n\nOnce my foot was in the boot, it was like a second skin. There was pressure in most places that usually hurt or are uncomfortable, but no pain. I put on the other boot and clomped around my apartment for a few hours. The fit was spot on. No heel slip, no uncomfortable pressure spots. I have worn them 4 more times since and the break in is going very well. They are only getting more comfortable, and the sole is less stiff than it was out of the box. Despite being a wingtip boot and looking fabulous, they seem pretty tough and my feet/legs are really gripped and supported nicely. I have already gotten some comments on them and really like wearing them. The single issue is the tongue on the right boot doesn\u2019t want to stay put while I\u2019m wearing them, but I\u2019m going to have the workshop tack them in place when I get the time.\n\nIN CONCLUSION \n\nGreat first foray into quality footwear. I\u2019ve always had problems with shoes and was hesitant to buy RTW shoes at typical GYW prices, so I gave MTM a go and couldn\u2019t be more pleased. Bojan\u2019s prices make it a lot easier to make the jump too. I can\u2019t recommend Zeb enough.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_2t0tx1ll", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Zeb Shoes Giau boot Initial Impressions", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/goodyearwelt", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_aps1o9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52, "domain": "self.goodyearwelt", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 52, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1549990370.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1549996514.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/rieVixS\"&gt;Album First&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow footwear fanatics!

I also have an instep that resembles the forehead of a sea lion beach master and my foot is wide back through the instep, making the heavy modifications to the last necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once my foot was in the boot, it was like a second skin. There was pressure in most places that usually hurt or are uncomfortable, but no pain. I put on the other boot and clomped around my apartment for a few hours. The fit was spot on. No heel slip, no uncomfortable pressure spots. I have worn them 4 more times since and the break in is going very well. They are only getting more comfortable, and the sole is less stiff than it was out of the box. Despite being a wingtip boot and looking fabulous, they seem pretty tough and my feet/legs are really gripped and supported nicely. I have already gotten some comments on them and really like wearing them. The single issue is the tongue on the right boot doesn\u2019t want to stay put while I\u2019m wearing them, but I\u2019m going to have the workshop tack them in place when I get the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IN CONCLUSION &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great first foray into quality footwear. I\u2019ve always had problems with shoes and was hesitant to buy RTW shoes at typical GYW prices, so I gave MTM a go and couldn\u2019t be more pleased. Bojan\u2019s prices make it a lot easier to make the jump too. I can\u2019t recommend Zeb enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ebc3cb6bb455bc793f4b313ee2d9fa8282bd609a", "width": 2448, "height": 3264}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=261968cd14a6eddfd736ac8f841a66628ed8c623", "width": 108, "height": 144}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76bb9c96e712013dfeb7e0b22b5bb91e41bbc50a", "width": 216, "height": 288}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a5efa88887bffa222c3e268590f46e3b7f7ae2", "width": 320, "height": 426}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15e11855402f95dffa88f0545a807cd869cd996c", "width": 640, "height": 853}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68014a96c95457501245b3237430e75165767153", "width": 960, "height": 1280}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/zoWLTPLDg3YNdO1YguThiHxkWs_OAiXXS3N9JNoQIko.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aef23da84bf6330481eebad1fa78b88e51b7b0e8", "width": 1080, "height": 1440}], "variants": {}, "id": "J1QjXQt1rIvdoLmmi6oL-KZpu3-7tScdpgtR2PzEXuQ"}], "enabled": false}, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w64o", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "aps1o9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Charismo82", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/goodyearwelt/comments/aps1o9/zeb_shoes_giau_boot_initial_impressions/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/aps1o9/zeb_shoes_giau_boot_initial_impressions/", "subreddit_subscribers": 92022, "created_utc": 1549967714.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "goodyearwelt", "selftext": "Hi all, this is my first post/review so please be gentle!

They were my first GYW boots and I wanted some quality boots for the winter due to me having cold feet quite often. I've worn these daily for two winters (november/december till february). \n\n**Details**: \n\nModel: Vancouver Boot\n\nSize: 7D\n\nColor: Brown\n\nStyle: Cap toe boot\n\nSole: Vibram Commando Sole\n\nWelt: 360 degree goodyear welt\n\nPrice: I've paid \u20ac277,- for these in the sale (313,99 dollars).\n\n**Fit**: I'm a guy with small feet (eu 39) so it's quite hard finding fitting GYW shoes/boots. These Vancouver boots are size 7D and fit like a glove. The inside is lined with sheepswool which makes the boots a bit tighter so keep that in mind when ordering this pair. \n\n**Appearance**: I love the brown color on these. Sadly this color isn't available anymore on the AE website for some reason. The boots themselves are a bit bulky, especially with my smaller feet but it's not too bad. \n\n**Impressions/Quality**: I own a few GYW boots and these are my go to winter boots. I've ordered them with sheepwhool lining and they are incredibly warm during the cold winter days. Be warned however, when wearing these for longer periods indoors you'll begin sweating and due to the lining it takes a long time to dry up. \n\nI've worn these boots daily for about 7-8 months total (2 winters) and they've held up great. I condition them before and after the winter and brush them off when they're wet or dirty. There is a bit of creasing on the vamp but very minimal and a few scratches here and there but those usually disappear when conditioning them. \n\n**Final thoughts**: These are some amazing quality boots. They've held up quite well and I expect to wear them for years to come. They're incredibly warm so perfect for the cold winters. This specific boot doesn't seem to get the most love within the AE/GYW community which is why I figured I'd show these off!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_msebu", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Allen Edmonds Vancouver boot [1 year review]", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/goodyearwelt", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_aoscud", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 82, "domain": "self.goodyearwelt", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 82, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1549719468.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1549748034.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, this is my first post/review so please be gentle!

Here's me giving back: my first boot review. Don't grab some popcorn, it probably isn't that entertaining. Here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nI have been an Allen Edmonds customer for the last half decade. I started by purchasing a pair of the Walnut colored cap toe Strand oxfords in size 9.5 D. The quality of and the timeless business and formal applications of that shoe, made me a believer in the brand. Since then, I purchased many more shoes to be of lesser quality than the Strand, and have mostly moved away from the brand as a whole, after buying 10 shoes of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I Was Looking For**\n\nFor this purchase, I was looking for something like a Service Boot / Military Boot / Heritage boot, but more comfortable than some of the popular that are suggested here. Also the look needed to be more form fitting, less bulbous, or overly zealous. Something semi rugged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Review**\n\nI started off the purchase of the Normandy boots in rocky waters. I got a decent price on a recent sale from A&amp;E, however the first boot they shipped out (size 9 D) was defective. It should have been a factory second at best. There was a 1/2\" cut in the leather, and a 2 in demarcation in the leather that indicted some damage. I contacted A&amp;E live chat, explained what I had gotten, and received good customer service and a good resolution to the matter. I re-ordered the shoe in a size 8.5 D this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter receiving the second pair of the Normandy boots, and upon a casual inspection, I think the quality the second time around was what you expect from a new shoe purchase. The boots came in a different box than A&amp;E used to use, some might say of lesser quality. One thing I should mention is after visiting the Southcoast Plaza, California, store location for A&amp;E, and noticing how they redesigned the store to be more hip and chic, is maybe there is a re-branding going on with the brand. You can even see it online with the pictures they use, more form fitting clothing being displayed on top of their shoes. The box would indicate the same. There was no dust cover, that is an additional $2, nickling and diming I am not used to from A&amp;E. You do get a second pair of laces, but you will probably be better suited to buy a good pair of  leather laces for $10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the shoe itself, the Kudu leather is soft and somewhat distressed, not as much as some pairs I have seen. This will vary from boot to boot of course. The quality of the leather seems okay, its soft, so you should easily expect more visible and easier wear than your Heritage boot. The leather is not as thick as lets say the Wolverine 1000 mile boot or the Chippewa service boot. But it looks nice, and can easily be dressed up or down to a certain extent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe insole is firm, I haven't broken it in yet, just put on my first hour in these boots around the house. My second pair came with the rubber sole, which is going to give much more traction than the leather sole, I can already feel it on the marble floors in the house. Durability wise, not sure, but it is probably not going to be good as a Vibram sole. Breaking in shouldn't take long, they are already comfortable, although I am hoping the in sole will become a little more comfortable as it forms to my feet. Even as is, it is significantly more comfortable than some of the Heritage boot options, specifically the Wolverine 1000 mile. You should be able to get a full day of wear without having aching feet, with a good pair of socks of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all a solid boot at a price point. I paid around $200, and if you can pay that price or less, this would be a great boot to add to the collection. It will fit in between a Heritage Boot and a Dress Boot. Probably thrive in the urban and city landscape very well. Not so much for the elements from what I have assumed at this point. Time will tell. Anything above that price point, and you have more and more options. I am really hoping the durability on the leather is better than a lot of the A&amp;E shoes I have purchased. I don't want to see premature wearing around the heels from driving which is a major point of contention for me in cheaper leather shoes.", "author_fullname": "t2_3xzkw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Review: Allen Edmonds Normandy Cap Toe Boot", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/goodyearwelt", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"b69221ez5gf21": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "s": {"y": 3024, "x": 4032, "u": "https://i.redd.it/b69221ez5gf21.jpg"}, "m": "image/jpg", "id": "b69221ez5gf21"}}, "name": "t3_aonkw8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38, "domain": "self.goodyearwelt", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CUkpH6XQS18MDkNQ9GAsVzNpKjDhfldH5oqyP6NED3o.jpg", "edited": 1549679310.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1549704517.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/b69221ez5gf21.jpg\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/b69221ez5gf21.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/gp/162158874@N06/0kdSD1\"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/gp/162158874@N06/0kdSD1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been soaking in a lot of information from this sub in the last few weeks.

You do get a second pair of laces, but you will probably be better suited to buy a good pair of  leather laces for $10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the shoe itself, the Kudu leather is soft and somewhat distressed, not as much as some pairs I have seen. This will vary from boot to boot of course. The quality of the leather seems okay, its soft, so you should easily expect more visible and easier wear than your Heritage boot. The leather is not as thick as lets say the Wolverine 1000 mile boot or the Chippewa service boot. But it looks nice, and can easily be dressed up or down to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The insole is firm, I haven&amp;#39;t broken it in yet, just put on my first hour in these boots around the house. My second pair came with the rubber sole, which is going to give much more traction than the leather sole, I can already feel it on the marble floors in the house. Durability wise, not sure, but it is probably not going to be good as a Vibram sole. Breaking in shouldn&amp;#39;t take long, they are already comfortable, although I am hoping the in sole will become a little more comfortable as it forms to my feet. Even as is, it is significantly more comfortable than some of the Heritage boot options, specifically the Wolverine 1000 mile. You should be able to get a full day of wear without having aching feet, with a good pair of socks of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all a solid boot at a price point. I paid around $200, and if you can pay that price or less, this would be a great boot to add to the collection. It will fit in between a Heritage Boot and a Dress Boot. Probably thrive in the urban and city landscape very well. Not so much for the elements from what I have assumed at this point. Time will tell. Anything above that price point, and you have more and more options. I am really hoping the durability on the leather is better than a lot of the A&amp;amp;E shoes I have purchased. I don&amp;#39;t want to see premature wearing around the heels from driving which is a major point of contention for me in cheaper leather shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TXfC51MZnTgI2FqMRlj0GfKR04hg7nW5wEgtsN4-FVo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6b9c7775da484cb3220276be1e4bf7c8346ea886", "width": 1024, "height": 768}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TXfC51MZnTgI2FqMRlj0GfKR04hg7nW5wEgtsN4-FVo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41744251e4ba7e32bb7458fc623983c12fe7d197", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TXfC51MZnTgI2FqMRlj0GfKR04hg7nW5wEgtsN4-FVo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2258d10ea56e593852a9e7f4eb8653ada799dcdf", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TXfC51MZnTgI2FqMRlj0GfKR04hg7nW5wEgtsN4-FVo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=709159de9055a3e67766eeb81fc70f5c38b98fcb", "width": 320, "height": 240}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TXfC51MZnTgI2FqMRlj0GfKR04hg7nW5wEgtsN4-FVo.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a478812e777adb2f241aa7c4596f281d261ccd8c", "width": 640, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TXfC51MZnTgI2FqMRlj0GfKR04hg7nW5wEgtsN4-FVo.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6aa512fc58194b7b87f38b4363ddf77822828427", "width": 960, "height": 720}], "variants": {}, "id": "xY6TDl-rpSlqLCHplB1x2q49CxHUCj9Ypczzav_kpn4"}], "enabled": false}, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w64o", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "aonkw8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "arplayer2k", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 36, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/goodyearwelt/comments/aonkw8/review_allen_edmonds_normandy_cap_toe_boot/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/aonkw8/review_allen_edmonds_normandy_cap_toe_boot/", "subreddit_subscribers": 92022, "created_utc": 1549675717.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "goodyearwelt", "selftext": "https://i.redd.it/db8nag2p9ff21.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first pair of proper boots!
